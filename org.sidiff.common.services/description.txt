Library
Provides the infrastructure for services in SiDiff. It includes tools for registration, configuration, request and an event bus.

Detailed documentation on the concept of Services in SiDiff and 
Howtos for creating and using services can be found in the 
document "Service-Howto" which is located at 
\url{http://svn.informatik.uni-siegen.de/SiDiff/trunk/doc/service-howto}.

This bundle also provides a debug service. This service can be used by applications.
Once put into the ServiceContext of the application it can be used to query
different information from the services within this context. Therefore, the
application should be started with the (OSGi-)argument "-console" and the
VM argument "-Dosgi.noShutdown=true". Then the debug service provides query
commands at the OSGi console.
